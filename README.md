# CryptoClustering


## About

In this jupyter noteboook I am using machine learning to create clusters of data based on crypto currency prices over a given time period.  
Scikit-learn is used extensively (Standard Scaler, PCA, KMeans).  The goal is to cluster data to better understand how the data is grouped and
where we can identify areas of opportunity or influence in the data.


## Key Features
- Sci-kit learn
- Kmeans and finding the best value for K with the elbow method.
- PCA
- Standard Scaler
- Plotting data
- 


## Installation
Requires the following dependencies
- Install [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download )
